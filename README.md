> fStretch is a rigging plug-in for Autodesk MayaÂ®. It is a surprisingly versatile tool which is proficient at creating advanced deformations on polygonal geometries. Its unique work flow allows one to precisely control effects such as stretch and squash, wrinkles and fat deformations to name a few. At one end, it lets one create cartoony rig with stunning stretch and squash while at the other end, it will allow another to create very realistic fat deformations. The beauty behind this is that both of those effects result from the very same technique.

>Since the algorithm behind is drastically optimized, the plug-in is able to compute real-time results on geometries made of 40,000 triangles* on most recent processors. If speed is not an issue, one can generate results on geometries containing as much as 400,000 triangles* while running at around 2fps. It is also possible to use fStretch for driving displacement maps. This way, excessively detailed deformations can be created.

The plug-in is now donation based, which means that you can grab it for free, along with the source code. If you like it and it's useful for you and you want to show gratitude, please make a donation to your favorite cause.
